**Upgrade of notebook:**

Piece|Model
:----|:----
SSD|240GB (I added a common SSD between 240GB for windows, because the notebook comes with an empty space inside it for exactly that.)
Memory|20GB (Notebook comes with two 4GB sticks in one is soldered. So I removed a 4GB stick and added a 16GB 2666 stick for a total of 20GB 2666)
WIFI Card|Fenvi (I changed the notebook's original wifi card, because the one that came in my notebook was unfortunately only compatible with windows and detail (it was also not from intel so it didn't have compatibility with macOS). So I bought an Aliexpress card from Fenvi and successfully the Wifi worked natively) 
Update BIOS|VERSION (I did a bios update normally like everyone else does and after that I also made a bios modification so that the notebook had the same behavior as the macbook pro)
